# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is a classic introductory machine learning problem that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on demographic and travel information.

---

## 📌 Objective
To build a classification model that predicts passenger survival using historical Titanic data.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle’s Titanic competition and includes features such as:
- Passenger Class
- Sex
- Age
- Fare
- Port of Embarkation

---

## 🔍 Approach
1. Data loading and exploration
2. Data cleaning and handling missing values
3. Feature encoding
4. Train-test split
5. Logistic Regression model training
6. Model evaluation using accuracy score

---

## 📈 Results
- Achieved approximately **78% accuracy** using Logistic Regression.
